# TCP-Serial-UDP-Communication-GUI
PySide6  Serial Communication, UDP Broadcast and TCP Server, Client Program. 

Each Tab has unique purpose.
In serial Tab, you can send data to hardware in ascii or hex format.

In UDP part, select the broadcast IP and port, after that push the data and listen via clients.

In TCP Server and Client tabs, unlike UDP tab I divided the tab by two. Send data or file to client tab. Like in UDP part, select IPs and ports and if are equal, send the data each other.
